# Fundamental types

For a more complete list see: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types

## Boolean

```cpp
bool answer = true; // or false
```

## Characters

```cpp
char c = 'A';
```

## Integers

```cpp
int i = 42;
```

with variations of `signed` | `unsigned` and `short` | `long` | `long long` (at least 64 bits)

## Floating-point numbers

```cpp
float f = 3.14f;
double d = 2.718;
long double ld = 1.6022e-19L; 
```

Exercise: Find out about types and value ranges 
using [example code](../examples/types/fundamental.cpp).
